# lorenz_attractor.py
This Python script visualizes the Lorenz attractor using the Manim library. Below is a list of functions and classes defined in the script, along with their explanations.

1. **lorenz_system(t, state, sigma=10, rho=28, beta=8/3)**
   - Defines the Lorenz system of differential equations.
   - Parameters:
     - `t`: Time variable (not used in the equations but required by the solver).
     - `state`: A list or array containing the current values of x, y, and z.
     - `sigma`, `rho`, `beta`: Parameters of the Lorenz system.
   - Returns: A list of derivatives [dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt].

2. **ode_solution_points(function, state0, time, dt=0.01)**
   - Computes solution points for an ordinary differential equation (ODE) using the `solve_ivp` function from SciPy.
   - Parameters:
     - `function`: The ODE function to solve.
     - `state0`: Initial state of the system.
     - `time`: Total time for which to solve the ODE.
     - `dt`: Time step for the solution.
   - Returns: A transposed array of solution points.

3. **class LorenzAttractor(ThreeDScene)**
   - A class for visualizing the Lorenz attractor using Manim's 3D scene capabilities.
   - Methods:
     - `construct()`: Sets up the 3D scene, defines the Lorenz system, computes solution points, and animates the attractor.

4. **class EndScreen(Scene)**
   - An empty scene class for the end screen. It currently does not contain any functionality.

5. **Main Execution Block**
   - Renders the `LorenzAttractor` scene using Manim and automatically opens the rendered video file.
   - Platform-specific commands are used to open the video file on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Usage:
- To run the script and visualize the Lorenz attractor, execute the following command in the terminal:
  ```
  manim -pqh lorenz_attractor.py LorenzAttractor
  ```

Dependencies:
- Manim Community v0.18.1
- SciPy
- NumPy

Ensure all dependencies are installed and properly configured before running the script.
